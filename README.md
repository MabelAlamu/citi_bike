# Citi Bike Performance Report 2018-2020

## Overview
In 2018 and 2019, the number of trips increases in March when it begins to get warmer, and ridership peaks in July or August. In colder months, the number of trips reduces, with an initial decline in September. 

Peak Hours are similar during the summer and winter months, but more rides occur during the peak hours of the summer months. Peak hours in the morning are between 6 am to 9 am, and in the evenings, peak hours are between 5 pm and 7 pm.

## COVID-19 Impact
